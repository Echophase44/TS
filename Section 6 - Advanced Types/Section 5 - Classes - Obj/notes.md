## Added things in Typescript

- Public / Private keywords
- Readonly for properties
- Constructor shorthand
- Protected // can be accessed inside the main class and other classes it extends to, "private" ones do not.
- static keyword infront of methods to make it accessible ouside of the class without creating an instance.
- Abstract Classes: If you have a method that is abstract, you have to make the class abstract too. Abstract meaning to leave the method empty, to ensure that extended classes have to provide their own conditions in the method.

## Interface

- Describes what an object should look like.
